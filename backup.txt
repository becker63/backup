Using a loop in the example below will continue reading the file until the EOF is reached, which returns a value of 1 (a
n integer) after each success. When it fails or reaches t
he end of the file, it will return EOF or -1. So, the condit
ion in the while loop below is like saying "while it kee
ps returning success, keep trying to scan the file, and 
break out of the loop when it fails."
